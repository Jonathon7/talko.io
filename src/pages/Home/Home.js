              The foundation of this application, socket.io was the choice for
              its ease of set up, and whoâ€™s features lends itself perfectly to
              the task of creating a distributable React tool able to be
              installed by a React developer by providing both server-side and
              client-side components with similar APIs.

            <h1>Uses Styled Components</h1>
            <p>
              Much like React Components themselves, Styled Components allow an
              alternate, more intuitive application of CSS to React that
              enhances readability while decreasing complexity by allowing
              smaller, more independent and reusable components.

            <h1>Built With React</h1>
            <p>
              When an open source application is desired, and less interaction
              with a back end, with responsiveness is required, React is a must
              with its SPA Architecture. React.js, is a comprehensive JavaScript
              library for building user interfaces changing the way developers
              think about front-end development.
